Synopsis:               Inline C & Objective-C code in Haskell for language interoperability
Description:            This library provides inline C & Objective-C code using GHC's support for
                        quasi-quotation. In particular, it enables the use of foreign libraries
                        without a dedicated bridge or binding. Here is a tiny example:
                        .
                        > nslog :: String -> IO ()
                        > nslog msg = $(objc ['msg :> ''String] (void [cexp| NSLog(@"Here is a message from Haskell: %@", msg) |]))
                        .

                        * New in 0.8.0: Support for ISO C, courtesy Erik de Castro Lopo <erikd@mega-nerd.com>
                        .
                        * New in 0.7.9: C wrapper names include the filename to disambiguate linker symbols.
                        .
                        * New in 0.7.6: (1) Record marshalling; (2) foreign pointer-class marshalling; (3) custom type
                        marshallers. Generated _objc.m files now always include "HsFFI.h" (as the tool can generate type names
                        declared in that header). Marshals 'Bool' as 'BOOL'. Marshal 'Int' and 'Word' to 'NSInteger' and
                        'NSUInteger', respectively.
                        .
                        * New in 0.6.0: Introduction of explicit marshalling hints (for more flexibility and support of
                        GHC 7.8's untyped Template Haskell quotations)
                        .
                        * New in 0.5.0: Marshalling of numeric types
                        .
                        * New in 0.4.0: Maybe types are marshalled as pointers that may be nil & bug fixes.
                        .
                        * New in 0.3.0: Boxed Haskell types without a dedicated type mapping are marshalled using stable
                        pointers.
                        .
                        * New in 0.2.0: Support for multiple free variables in one inline expression as well
                        as for inline code returning 'void'.
                        .
                        * New in 0.1.0: We are just getting started! This is just a ROUGH AND
                        HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPE.
